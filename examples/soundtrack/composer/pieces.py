"""Resolve a piece name to its composition module and instrument directory.

soundtrack/ is example content, not infrastructure: treat it as
disposable (it might be renamed, restructured, or deleted independently
of this tooling). This is the one place that hardcodes its location.

Each piece lives in its own subdirectory of soundtrack/:

  soundtrack/<Piece>/composition.py
  soundtrack/<Piece>/instruments/*.py

A composition may set INSTRUMENTS_DIR to a path relative to its piece
directory.  That lets new pieces opt into the shared lib/instruments
library while historical pieces keep their frozen private patches.

Piece names are matched case-insensitively, so `--piece automata` finds
`Automata/`. Instruments are owned per piece on purpose: the scripts are
the patches, and the generated projects embed them byte-for-byte, so a
shared library would let a tweak made for a new piece silently change how
an old one renders. Starting a new piece means copying the closest
existing instrument and letting it diverge.

A composition module exposes: TITLE, SAMPLE_RATE, MASTER_GAIN_DB,
TEMPO_MAP (rows of (beat, bpm) or (beat, bpm, ts_num, ts_den)),
TOTAL_BEATS, SONG_SECONDS, RENDER_SECONDS, SECTIONS (name, start_beat,
end_beat), TRACKS, beats_to_seconds(), track_gain(), macro_value(),
active_track_count(), and optionally ACTIVE_LIMIT (None for no limit)
and CLIMAX_SECTION. A track may also carry an effects list; each entry embeds
one MPVST Effect script after the instrument and uses the same macros /
macro_env shape as an instrument.
