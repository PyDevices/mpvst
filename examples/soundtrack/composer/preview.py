"""Render a piece offline through the audiodsp CPython wheel.

The render loop, the tempo math, the mixing and the level report all live
in audiodsp's `audiorender`. What stays here is the part that is about this
plug-in: instruments are loaded the way the sidecar loads them - a script
exec'd against the vstaudio shim - rather than imported as
`audioinstruments` modules. That keeps the preview a check on the same
path the bounce takes. The shim drives the same adapter as the sidecar, so
normalized host values cross the same MIDI-unit boundary in both paths.

Writes a stereo master WAV plus an analysis report (peaks, RMS per
section, simultaneous-track counts).

Usage: render_preview.py [--piece NAME] [out.wav] [--stems DIR]
