"""Velvet Circuit - a retro-future jazz/prog main title.

This is the first soundtrack piece built directly from the shared hardware
library and the first with real MPVST Effect inserts.  It deliberately
turns away from Perihelion's orchestral film language and Automata's EDM arc:
an imaginary 1978 crime series discovered on a satellite in 2049.

The signature is a clipped F-minor horn line over a 5/4 pocket.  The middle
opens into an Ab-major 6/8 love theme, a 7/8 rooftop chase changes the camera
angle, and the final title reprise puts all three melodic identities in
counterpoint.  The last credits cadence resolves not to a plain tonic but to
F minor/major ambiguity (F-C-Ab-A-D-G): the mystery remains open next week.

All instruments resolve from ../../lib/instruments.  Effect scripts below are
only racks: every processor they instantiate comes from audioeffects.

# These racks predate the rebuilt effects. Each old Freeverb preset maps to
# the shipped Reverb patch whose measured decay and brightness sit nearest
# it (spring is parked in the rebuilt Reverb; Short Plate is nearest), and
# each Mix is the old one doubled, because the rebuilt Mix runs 0 to 2 on the
# law the old one ran 0 to 1 on. A patch sets every macro, Mix included, so
# Mix is set after it. The rebuilt Chorus is one delayed voice: Delay is the
# old line's centre (depth_ms + 8 ms), Depth its swing as a fraction of
# that, Tone open because the old one had no wet filter. Saturation's old
# amount was its dry/wet blend, which is Mix now. Vibrato's Depth is in
# cents, and Rise is at its shortest because the old one had none.
# Overdrive is a Tube Screamer now: Drive is its gain (12 to 108), placed so
# the old default 0.4 lands on the new default; Tone is the position whose
# low-pass corner (480 x 18^Tone Hz) is the old tone_hz. Mix is still how
# much of the drive you hear, though it now adds the clipped copy to a dry
# note at unity instead of crossfading - except on the clav and the guitar.
# Those parts are quiet enough that the old curve, backed off as it was,
# barely clipped them, while the new circuit clips at any level and adds that
# copy at a level of its own: the old Mix put both tracks 15 dB over what the
# old rack gave. Their Mix is the one at which the stage's level on the
# track's own part matches the old one's. The delays keep Time, Feedback and
# Mix; TapeDelay's wow is the old 2.5 ms swing at 0.7 Hz as cents, with no
# flutter, the old loop drive (0.3) and the old line length (twice Time); its
# repeats cannot be as bright as the old tone_hz at these Times, so Spacing
# is at its brightest. SlapbackDelay's Level is the old Mix doubled (Echo's
# 0-1 law became 0-2), with no saturation, wobble or tone filter, as before.
