"""Render a project to a WAV here, with no DAW and no plug-in.

    from mpvst_composer.backends.offline import OfflineRenderer
    song.render("song.wav", OfflineRenderer)

The Reaper backend writes a project for a host to play. This one plays it,
through the same DSP: `audiorender` is audiodsp's offline renderer, and it
drives the very `audioinstruments` and `audioeffects` packages the sidecar
imports. Same notes, same components, same arithmetic, on a machine with
nothing installed on it.

It is not the quick way. This runs at about the speed of the music - sixteen
voices over two and a half minutes take two and a half minutes - where Reaper
bounces the same project in twenty-six seconds, eighteen sidecar startups and
all. What you get here is a render that needs no DAW and no plug-in, not a
render that arrives sooner.

It does not go through the vstaudio shim, because there is nothing left for
the adapter to do: `audiorender.deliver` crosses the normalized-to-MIDI seam
with the same multiply `mpvst_instrument_adapter` uses. Routing through a
script to reach the same multiply would buy a dependency on the installed
product and no fidelity. Two things the adapters do that the bare renderer
does not are guarded below, both places a component declares fewer than
sixteen macros.

The plug-in is still where the catalog comes from: `Project` reads patch
names, macro ranges and class IDs out of an installed bundle's
`catalog.json`. Without one, patches resolve to zero and this renders a
different arrangement than the bounce - the composer warns when that
happens, and `MPVST_BUNDLE` points it at the install.

What it cannot tell you is whether the plug-in works. The class IDs, the
state chunk, the item timing and the send topology are all things the
project file asserts and only a host can honour. Render here while you are
writing; render through Reaper before you believe it.

Not yet mixed here: pan automation (the pan is static, as in `apply_mix`)
and sidechain keys.

Needs `pydevices-audioif`, `pydevices-audioinstruments` and
`pydevices-audioeffects`.
