"""Give every instrument patch 0 describing the sound it already makes.

Every instrument must declare at least one patch: piece.py resolves an
unset macro to the instrument's patch 0 rather than to the middle of its
range, and the middle of a range is not "off" and not what the author
intended. That contract is only safe if the patch is genuinely the
instrument's designed sound, so this derives it rather than inventing it.

An instrument's own defaults already are that sound - volume = 0.8,
cutoff_base = 2000.0. For each macro this:

  1. builds the instrument and snapshots every number it can reach,
  2. feeds the macro 0 then 127 to see which of them it moves, which
     discovers the macro -> parameter binding without parsing anything,
  3. scans all 128 settings and keeps the one that puts those parameters
     closest to the snapshot.

Patch values are MIDI integers, so a scan is exact where a search would
only approach: there are 128 settings and it tries all of them. Anything
unbound, ambiguous or unreachable is reported and never guessed - an
unreachable default means the macro cannot restore the designed sound,
which is a bug in the instrument, not something to paper over.

Two things make this different from probing a module's globals, which is
what it used to do. An instrument's parameters live in the closure that
`create()` builds, so they are read through `handle_event`'s free
variables - the same per-instance state, reached the only way it can be.
And `create()` ends by applying patch 0, which would make deriving patch 0
circular, so the instrument is built with that step suppressed: what gets
measured is the sound its own code leaves behind.

An instrument that already declares a patch 0 keeps it. Not every patch 0
is derived - minimoog's is one of three designed patches, and create()
applies it so the instrument starts there - so overwriting one has to be
asked for. The report marks a disagreement `~`, sized in the parameter's
own units. A default that sits midway between two settings is a tie, not
a disagreement: the committed setting is kept, so rederiving is stable.

Usage:
    derive_patches.py                    report, write nothing
    derive_patches.py --write            fill in a missing PATCHES block
    derive_patches.py --write --force    rederive patch 0 as well
    derive_patches.py --write minimoog ms20
