"""Run every instrument script through the real synthio DSP.

Uses the soundtrack composer's harness (the audiodsp CPython wheel, no compiled engine or
VST3 host needed) to catch exactly the class of bug that py_compile can't:
API misuse that only raises once a note is actually played (e.g. an
invalid kwarg to synthio.Note/Math), and macros that are read but never
reach the audio graph.

Two sets of scripts, driven the same way. lib/instruments/*.py are
generated loaders, so running them covers the whole sidecar path bar the
engine: shim -> mpvst_instrument_adapter -> audioinstruments. That is deliberate.
audiodsp holds the instruments themselves to byte-exact parity goldens,
which is a far stronger check than anything here; what is untested
without this is the seam - the adapter, the staged import, the generated
label line.

The soundtrack's piece-private instruments are whole scripts rather than
loaders, and they run through the same path because that is how the
plug-in loads them: as `__main__`, ending in a call to the adapter.

For each script:
  - checks its macro-label line against the MACRO_LABELS it declares (a
    shim's are generated, a private instrument's are two literals side by
    side), and loads it fresh, catching import-time and note-on errors
  - sweeps every declared macro through {0.0, 0.5, 1.0} while holding a
    note, and asserts the sweep never raises
  - plays a short chord - or the machine's own mapped voices, for a drum
    machine - at default macro settings, and asserts the script actually
    produces non-silent audio
  - releases every voice and asserts that doesn't raise either

This is a fast correctness net, not a substitute for hearing the
instrument in a DAW: it proves a script doesn't crash and isn't silent,
not that it sounds like the hardware it emulates.

Usage: test-instruments-lib.py [name.py ...]   (default: every script)
