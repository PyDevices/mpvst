# Tools

Developer-workflow and test infrastructure for the plug-in and the
instrument and effect scripts it loads: things you run repeatedly while
developing, not maintainer/CI automation. For fetching
dependencies, building the engine, packaging a release, or bootstrapping
a fresh clone (including REAPER), see [`../scripts/`](../scripts/README.md).

## Composing a piece

That moved. The soundtrack is example content, not infrastructure - it might
be renamed, restructured, or replaced independently of this - so the tools
that only serve it now live beside it in
[`../examples/soundtrack/composer/`](../examples/soundtrack/README.md):
`pieces.py` resolves a piece name to its `composition.py` and `instruments/`,
and `preview.py [--piece NAME] [out.wav] [--stems DIR]` renders one offline.

Both need the `audiodsp` wheel's venv - this repo's own `.venv` if you have set
one up:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ \
  pydevices-audiodsp pydevices-audioinstruments pydevices-audioeffects numpy
```

TestPyPI is the only index carrying those three; the extra index resolves
their ordinary dependencies. `preview.py` also needs MPVST installed, because
it loads instruments the way the sidecar does - through the bundle's
`mpvst_instrument_adapter`. Point `MPVST_BUNDLE` at the install if it is
somewhere unusual.

Which render path to reach for, and what each one does and does not prove, is
[`../docs/rendering.md`](../docs/rendering.md). Turning a piece into a real
REAPER project, and driving REAPER itself, is a separate, deletable concern -
see [`../reaper/README.md`](../reaper/README.md) and the root
[`../reaper.sh`](../reaper.sh) entry point.

## Testing

- **`../examples/soundtrack/composer/harness.py`** and **`vstaudio.py`**
  beside it - a CPython stand-in for the
  sidecar, built on the `audiodsp` wheel (the same `synthio`/`audiocore`
  DSP the real engine runs). Lets any instrument or effect script run
  without the compiled engine or a VST3 host, in milliseconds instead of
  the seconds a full plug-in load takes. `harness.py` provides
  `InstrumentRun` and `EffectRun`; `vstaudio.py` is the shim module
  scripts see as `import vstaudio`. `audiodsp` itself comes from the
  installed `pydevices-audiodsp` package (`harness.py` no longer puts a
  sibling checkout on `sys.path`, which used to win silently over the
  wheel); the components come from `MPVST_COMPONENTS_LIB`.
- **`test-instruments-lib.py [name ...]`** - runs every instrument
  script against `harness.py` - the 53 library instruments, whose loader
  scripts it synthesizes exactly as the plug-in does, and the
  soundtrack's 40 piece-private instruments: sweeps each declared macro through
  `0.0/0.5/1.0` under held notes, then checks a fresh instance produces
  audible output at default settings. Driving the shims covers the whole
  sidecar path bar the engine (shim to adapter to `audioinstruments`),
  which is the part audiodsp's own parity goldens cannot see. No engine or
  VST3 host needed; a full pass over all 93 takes about ten seconds.
  Registered as the `mpvst_instruments_library` ctest.
- **`smoke_host --expect-all-named`** - every plug-in the moduleinfo
  declares, instantiated through the real factory: the class is registered
  from a file, the processor builds its script from the same entry, and
  the sidecar imports the library module named in it. Also builds each
  one's controller, which is what proves a single shared controller class
  still speaks for whichever instrument named it. Registered as
  `mpvst_named_plugins`; the final gate.
- **`test-effects-lib.py <smoke_host> <bundle.vst3>`** - the equivalent
  suite for `audioeffects`: builds each class from `vstaudio.input()` and
  asserts the behavior it promises (squeezes, mutes, or passes a
  quiet/loud sine pair) through the real Effect class. Registered as
  `mpvst_effects_library`.
The two scripts above take a `smoke_host` path because they drive
[`../tests/smoke_host/`](../tests/) - a minimal C++ VST3 host that loads
the built bundle directly (no DAW) and runs one script through the real
processor. It lives with the tests because it is built only under
`BUILD_TESTING`; `ctest` passes its path automatically, and you only name
it by hand when running these two scripts yourself.

The one test that needs a real DAW - FX chain add/remove, parameter
automation, project save/reload, macro resync - lives in
[`../reaper/matrix/`](../reaper/README.md) instead of here, for the same
reason `tools/` and `reaper/` are split at all: everything in this
directory runs with no DAW.

`flake8` runs as the `mpvst_lint` ctest when it is installed, configured
in [`../.flake8`](../.flake8) to defect checks only - undefined names,
unused imports, dead `nonlocal` declarations - and not to layout, since
the scripts here are compact on purpose.

None of the `preview`-based tools prove a script sounds like the
hardware it's named after, or like anything in particular - only that it
doesn't crash and isn't silent. Hearing it is still on you, and what else
an offline render cannot tell you is in
[`../docs/rendering.md`](../docs/rendering.md).

## Patches

- **`derive_patches.py [--write [--force]] [name ...]`** - gives an
  instrument patch 0 (the default patch) that describes the sound it already makes, by
  measuring it rather than inventing it: snapshot every number the
  instrument's event handler can reach, feed each macro 0 then 127 to see
  which of them it moves, then scan all 128 settings and keep the one
  that lands closest to the snapshot. A scan rather than a search because
  patch values are 7-bit integers - there are only 128 answers, so trying
  all of them is exact.

  It builds the instrument with `create()`'s own `program_change(0)`
  suppressed, or deriving patch 0 from an instrument that has just
  applied patch 0 would be circular.

  An existing patch 0 is left alone: not all of them are derived -
  minimoog's is one of three designed patches - so overwriting takes
  `--force`. Run with no arguments to report. `!` marks a macro that
  cannot reach its default, naming the parameter and both values; `~`
  marks a committed patch value that disagrees with what was derived.
