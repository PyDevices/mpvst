"""Run every audioeffects class through the real sidecar.

For each public class this writes a tiny script that builds the effect
from vstaudio.input() with default-ish arguments, runs it through the
VST3 effect class via the smoke host's --effect-script probe (quiet sine
then loud sine), and asserts the behaviour the effect promises:
dynamics squeeze or mute the right half, everything else passes signal.

Usage: test-effects-lib.py <smoke_host> <bundle.vst3>
