# The one entry point for anything that needs REAPER. Everything else this
# repo does - building the plug-in, writing an instrument, previewing a
# composition offline - works without this file or the reaper/ directory
# beside it; both exist purely to drive REAPER, and both can be deleted as
# a unit by anyone who doesn't use it.
#
#   ./reaper.sh            regenerate the project, open REAPER, and play it
#                          through the speakers (REAPER stays open)
#   ./reaper.sh --render   headless verification render instead: bounce the
#                          whole piece offline, check every engine and the
#                          automation, and compare against the preview.
#                          Writes build/<Title>.wav and, beside it, the
#                          build/<Title>.RPP that produced it.
#
# The project embeds every instrument script in plug-in state, so REAPER
# needs no environment beyond MPVST_HEAP_BYTES for the sidecars.
