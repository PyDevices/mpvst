"""Run an `audioeffects` component inside the sidecar.

The instrument twin of this is `mpvst_instrument_adapter`, and the split is the same:
the effect library lives in audiocomponents and knows nothing about this
plug-in, so this module is the one place that knows both halves. An effect
factory takes the host input and sample rate and returns an object exposing
an `output` to pull from, which is exactly what `vstaudio.input()` and
`vstaudio.output()` provide.

    import mpvst_effect_adapter
    mpvst_effect_adapter.run("TapeDelay")

That line is what the plug-in builds for a named effect class, from the entry
`moduleinfo.json` carries for it - there are no generated shim files.

The adapter calls `audioeffects.create(name, source, sample_rate, **kwargs)`;
it does not instantiate an effect class directly. That package factory is the
audiodsp component factory boundary.

Macros work the same way they do for instruments - normalized 0.0-1.0 on the
wire, MIDI 0-127 to the library. The provider declares an empty macro surface
explicitly when an effect has no knobs; this consumer remains tolerant and
simply does not wire the parameter path for one. Such an effect still
processes audio, while a provider with macros receives those events here.
