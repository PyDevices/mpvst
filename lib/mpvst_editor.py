"""The editor's lifecycle inside the engine process.

The bootstrap calls `start()` once and hands the returned `tick` to
`vstaudio.run()`, which calls it from the engine's housekeeping step - the
moment where there is no audio to render. Everything the editor costs is
inside that call.

Three things are deliberate here.

Nothing is built until the host actually opens the editor. An instance that is
never opened pays for an unmapped region and one `editor_open()` read per
housekeeping pass; no LVGL, no panel, no allocations.

The app never owns a timer that fires by itself. `multimer`'s `polling`
backend only advances when something pumps it, and `App.poll()` is what pumps
it, so LVGL's tick, its task handler and the display refresh all happen inside
this module's `tick()` and nowhere else. That is the whole reason the panel can
share a heap with an audio renderer without a callback landing mid-render.

A panel that raises is torn down rather than retried. The failure is recorded
for the view to render, and audio carries on: a broken editor must be visible,
not fatal, and not a source of repeated exceptions in the render loop.
