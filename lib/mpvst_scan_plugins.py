"""Find every plug-in declared in audioinstruments and audioeffects.

Run it with the engine, from the folder it lives in:

    mpvst-engine.exe mpvst_scan_plugins.py

That needs no Python installed and behaves the same on Windows and Linux,
which is the whole reason it is written for the engine rather than for a
system interpreter. Run it after installing, and again after adding or
editing a script; the DAW picks up the result on its next rescan.

Writing is what it does: the installer runs it with no arguments, and a
scanner that only listed unless asked would leave a fresh install unscanned.
`--list` prints the table instead, `--json` prints the file it would write.

It writes one file, `../Resources/moduleinfo.json`: the list a host reads to
enumerate classes without loading the binary, and the same list the plug-in
binary reads at load to decide which classes it offers. One file, so there is
nothing for a second one to disagree with.

Reads the files as text rather than importing them - what is wanted is what
each module *declares*, and text gives the same answer without paying for a
synth's import or caring whether one is importable at all. A package frozen
into the engine has no files to read, so when one is not beside this script
the engine's own list of frozen modules (`vstaudio.frozen_files()`) stands
in for the directory, and each module is imported and its declarations read
from it instead: same files, same fields, so the same class IDs. Files beside
the script win, as they do on the sidecar's import path.

Where the fields live differs by package, and that is deliberate: an
instrument is one plug-in per file, so its fields sit at module level; an
effect file holds several classes, so each class carries its own. VENDOR is
always module level, because a file comes from one author.

NAME is the only required field. Everything else defaults, and anything
without a NAME is not a plug-in and is skipped - which is also how a helper
class or a base class stays out of the list without needing to be excluded
by name.

MACROS_COMMENT = "// mpvst-macros:"

# A class ID is 128 fixed bits and a plug-in is identified by arbitrary-length
# text, so something has to compress one into the other deterministically -
# which is all the hash is for. The seed is the file's path plus its NAME:
# the path because the filesystem already guarantees it unique, so a user who
# copies one of ours and edits it gets a distinct plug-in for free; the NAME
# because one effect file declares several.
#
# Renaming a file therefore makes a different plug-in and orphans projects
# that used the old one. That is the documented rule, and it is the price of
# not having to hand out identifiers.
# FROZEN. Every class ID is derived from this string, so changing it
# changes all of them and a saved project stops finding the plug-in it
# had on a track. It contains the old repository name because that is
# what the namespace was minted as; it is an identity, not a reference,
# and a stale-looking identity is a correct one. The repository became
# PyDevices/mpvst on 2026-09-11 and this deliberately did not move.

# come from no script - and a moduleinfo that omits them is not merely
# incomplete: a host that trusts the file never sees them at all, which is
# how the developer-loop plug-in went missing from projects that used it.
#
# The two controller classes here are also the ones every discovered plug-in
# names. One controller implementation serves all of them and learns which
# instrument it is from the component state, never from its own class, so
# there is nothing for a per-plug-in controller class to be.
#
# Held as identity only. Vendor, version and SDK version come from the module
# fields like everything else, so the only thing that can go stale is a CID
# or a name, and `moduleinfotool -validate` fails loudly when one does. The
# CIDs are src/plugin/source/cids.h and the names are factory.cpp.
