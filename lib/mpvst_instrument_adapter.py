"""Play an `audioinstruments` module inside the sidecar.

The instrument library lives in audiocomponents now, where it knows nothing
about this plug-in: an instrument is constructed through
`audioinstruments.create(name, sample_rate, ...)`, returning an object with
`note_on`/`note_off`/`set_macro`/`program_change` and an `output` to pull PCM
from. This module is the one place that knows both halves. It binds that
factory to `vstaudio`, so a script here shrinks to two lines. This is the
instrument side of audiodsp's component factory boundary:

    import mpvst_instrument_adapter
    mpvst_instrument_adapter.run("audioinstruments.tr808")

That line is what the plug-in builds for a named instrument, from the entry
`moduleinfo.json` carries for it - there are no generated shim files. The
soundtrack's piece-private instruments keep
their bodies and call `attach(create)` from a `__main__` guard instead,
because those files *are* the patches and are meant to be read and edited
in place.

Units are the reason this file exists. `vstaudio` hands out normalized
0.0-1.0 floats, which is what the VST3 parameter API speaks; the
instrument API speaks MIDI 0-127, which is what a keyboard, a sequencer
and a saved patch speak. The conversion happens here, once, at the seam -
and it is a multiply, not a quantization, so a host automating a macro
with more than 7 bits of resolution keeps every bit of it.

# already declares MACRO_LABELS and PATCHES for the library's own use, and the

# this seam, and the panel falls back to generic names there.
