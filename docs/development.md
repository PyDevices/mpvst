# Working on MPVST itself

Building the plug-in from source, running its gates, and cutting a release.
To write instruments or effects *for* MPVST - which needs none of this - see
[writing-scripts.md](writing-scripts.md).

## Repository layout

| | |
|---|---|
| `src/` | the C++ that builds the plug-in: `plugin/` (VST3 classes), `protocol/` (the shared-memory wire format), `runtime/` (shared memory and child processes) |
| `usermods/` | the MicroPython C modules the engine binds to: `vstaudio/` (the audio API scripts use) and `vstui/` (the editor's framebuffer, input and edit rings) |
| `lib/` | everything staged into the bundle beside the engine: the bootstrap, the adapters, `mpvst_scan_plugins.py`, the default instrument, and the editor's Python half (`mpvst_editor.py`, `mpvst_board_config.py`, `mpvst_panel/`) |
| `tools/` | developer tooling - the library test sweeps, `audio_qc.py`, `derive_patches.py` |
| `tests/` | the ctest suite and `smoke_host/`, a minimal VST3 host that loads the bundle with no DAW |
| `scripts/` | build, packaging and setup automation |
| `installer/` | what a user runs rather than builds: `windows.nsi` (the NSIS installer, cross-built from Linux) and `install-linux.sh`, which ships inside the tarball as `install.sh` |
| `reaper/` + `reaper.sh` | everything that drives REAPER. Deletable as a unit; nothing outside it depends on it |
| `examples/` | two composers with their songs, and `bounce.py`; nothing in here imports anything above it (rendering: [rendering.md](rendering.md)) |

The architecture is written down in
[docs/architecture/phase-0.md](architecture/phase-0.md) (the system
boundary and what each process owns) and
[docs/architecture/ipc-v1.md](architecture/ipc-v1.md) (the
shared-memory protocol rules), with
[docs/architecture/ui-v1.md](architecture/ui-v1.md) covering the
editor. `ipc-v1.md` and `ui-v1.md` describe the shipping design;
`phase-0.md` is historical - the Windows-only, no-editor design accepted
before Linux shipped and before the LVGL editor existed - kept for its
still-valid process/thread/state reasoning, not as a description of
what ships today. The canonical structure sizes and offsets live in
`src/protocol/include/mpvst/protocol.h` and `src/protocol/include/mpvst/ui.h`.

## Prerequisites

- A C++17 toolchain: MSVC on Windows, GCC or Clang on Linux.
  **The Windows plug-in binary is the one thing here that needs MSVC**, and
  the full Visual Studio IDE is not required - **Visual Studio Build Tools**
  with the Desktop C++ workload and a Windows SDK is enough, and is about
  half the disk:

  ```powershell
  winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.BuildTools --override ^
    "--quiet --wait --norestart --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools ^
     --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows11SDK.26100 --includeRecommended"
  ```

  The generator the install script names is `Visual Studio 18 2026`, so it
  wants the 2026 Build Tools (`18.x`); the winget id above has no year in it
  and resolves to that. Nothing else in the repository needs it: the Windows
  *sidecar engine* is cross-compiled from WSL with MinGW, the Linux build
  uses GCC, and a Python-only change to the instrument or effect library
  never touches a compiler at all (see [the staging note](#building-and-testing)).
- CMake 3.25+ and Ninja (`cmake -S . -B .build-linux -G Ninja` is the
  documented invocation below).
- On Linux, X11 development headers (`src/plugin/CMakeLists.txt` runs
  `find_package(X11 REQUIRED)` for the editor's native window) - e.g.
  `libx11-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu.
- Python 3.x for `tools/`, `scripts/`, and the `ctest`-registered Python
  suites; `numpy`, `pydevices-audiodsp`, `pydevices-audioinstruments` and
  `pydevices-audioeffects` (all from TestPyPI - see
  [`tools/README.md`](../tools/README.md)) for the instrument/effect tests
  and preview renders, and `flake8` for the `mpvst_lint` ctest.
  `scripts/bootstrap.sh` creates a repo-local `.venv` with these.
- The Steinberg VST3 SDK, fetched by `scripts/fetch-vst3-sdk.sh` into the
  gitignored `.deps/vst3sdk` (see [the licence note](../README.md#license) for its terms).
- The sibling `audiodsp` and `micropython-pydevices` checkouts, the other
  module repositories the engine preset names, and an upstream MicroPython
  clone at the pinned tag, which the MicroPython engine build depends on; and
  the sibling `audiocomponents` checkout whose `audioinstruments` and
  `audioeffects` packages the plug-in build stages into the bundle - all
  fetched by `scripts/fetch-sibling-repos.sh`.
- On WSL, building the Windows engine/plugin needs a reachable Windows
  host: `scripts/build-micropython-engine.sh --port windows` and
  `scripts/install-plugin-windows.sh` both shell out to `powershell.exe`,
  and `scripts/bootstrap.sh` skips the Windows engine port automatically
  when `/mnt/c/Users` or `powershell.exe` is not available.

## Getting started

A fresh clone has none of the external dependencies this repo needs - the
VST3 SDK, the sibling `audiodsp`, `micropython-pydevices` and MicroPython
checkouts the engine build depends on, the sibling `audiocomponents` repo the plug-in build stages its
instruments and effects from, or REAPER for the DAW-driven tooling. `.deps/`
and those sibling checkouts are all gitignored. One command sets all of it
up:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

See [scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md) for what it does and how to run
each step individually.

## Building and testing

The MicroPython sidecar is built separately from the plug-in, and only
needs rebuilding when `usermods/vstaudio`, `usermods/vstui`, or the
sibling audiodsp checkout's C sources change. It lands in the ignored
`.deps/engine/`, and the plug-in build stages it into the bundle. CMake
never detects a stale engine on its own - it only re-stages the file at
`MPVST_MICROPYTHON_ENGINE` if that path's mtime changes, so after any of
those three changes you must rerun the build script yourself before
reconfiguring/rebuilding the plug-in:

```bash
./scripts/build-micropython-engine.sh --port windows
./scripts/build-micropython-engine.sh --port unix
```

Linux:

```bash
cmake -S . -B .build-linux -G Ninja
cmake --build .build-linux
ctest --test-dir .build-linux --output-on-failure
```

Windows, driven from WSL with the vendored CMake. `scripts/install-plugin-windows.sh`
wraps the build and installs the result into the per-user VST3 directory a
DAW scans:

```bash
./scripts/install-plugin-windows.sh
```

### A Python-only change needs no compiler

Adding an instrument to audiocomponents, editing a script, or changing what
the catalog says does not touch the plug-in binary. If the Windows build
directory is gone - it lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp`, which Windows
cleans - you do not have to reconfigure MSVC to get the change into a DAW.
Stage the packages into the installed bundle and rewrite the two metadata
files with the bundle's own engine:

```bash
B="$WIN_LOCALAPPDATA/Programs/Common/VST3/MPVST.vst3/Contents/x86_64-win"
for pkg in audioinstruments audioeffects; do
    rm -rf "$B/$pkg" && mkdir -p "$B/$pkg"
    (cd ../audiocomponents/lib/$pkg && tar -cf - --exclude=__pycache__ \
        --exclude='*.egg-info' --exclude=pyproject.toml .) | (cd "$B/$pkg" && tar -xf -)
done
(cd "$B" && ./mpvst-engine.exe -X heapsize=64M mpvst_scan_plugins.py \
         && ./mpvst-engine.exe -X heapsize=64M mpvst_catalog.py)
```

That is what `cmake --build` does for these two directories, minus the
compiler: the excludes match `src/plugin/stage_lib.cmake`, and the two
scripts rewrite `moduleinfo.json` and `catalog.json`. A new instrument does
not need a REAPER rescan either - the soundtrack composer's projects load
the generic "MPVST Script Host" class with the script embedded in state, so
the only thing REAPER has to find is the staged package the sidecar imports.

### Reconfiguring the Windows build

`install-plugin-windows.sh` refuses to run without a configured build, which
is what you see after the Temp directory is cleaned or MSVC is reinstalled:

```bash
source scripts/windows-paths.sh && mpvst_load_windows_paths
'.deps/cmake-4.4.2-windows-x86_64/bin/cmake.exe' \
    -S "$(wslpath -w .)" -B "$(wslpath -w "$WIN_TEMP/mpvst-build")" \
    -G 'Visual Studio 18 2026'
```

The Linux CMake cache remembers the engine path. After switching engines,
reconfigure with
`cmake -S . -B .build-linux -U MPVST_MICROPYTHON_ENGINE`.

Steinberg hosting tools are off by default so a plug-in-only build does
not pull in editor-host dependencies. Enable them in a dedicated validator
build with `-DSMTG_ENABLE_VST3_HOSTING_EXAMPLES=ON`. `VST3_SDK_ROOT` may
point at an existing SDK checkout instead of the fetched one.

## Building a release

`VERSION` at the repository root is the single
source of truth - CMake and both packaging scripts read it, and editing it
re-runs CMake's configure step, so a binary and the archive around it
cannot disagree about which version they are.

```bash
./scripts/fetch-nsis.sh          # once, for the Windows installer
./scripts/package-linux.sh
./scripts/package-windows.sh
```

Each produces a versioned archive plus a SHA-256 sidecar under the ignored
`dist/`, after verifying the bundle carries its engine and bootstrap;
`package-windows.sh` also builds the installer, from the same staging tree
the archive is made from, so the two cannot ship different bytes. The
installer is built by NSIS, which cross-builds a Windows installer from
Linux - `fetch-nsis.sh` unpacks it into `.deps/` rather than installing it
on the machine, so it needs no root and removing `.deps` removes it.
See [docs/windows/README.md](windows/README.md) and
[docs/linux/README.md](linux/README.md) for the development
install paths and the desktop-script security model.

This repository deliberately has no hosted CI. The 14-test `ctest` suite
(lint included) is the gate, and it is run locally - by a developer before
pushing, or by `scripts/bootstrap.sh` as its final verification step.
Hosted CI is planned to arrive with the post-program refactor, not before.

## Testing against a real DAW

`ctest` covers the plug-in with no DAW involved. Two further harnesses use
REAPER, and both need the packaged plug-in installed first because they
exercise the installed bundle:

```bash
./reaper/matrix/run-reaper-matrix.sh --platform windows
./reaper/matrix/run-reaper-matrix.sh --platform linux
```

The matrix drives REAPER headlessly through a startup ReaScript, covering
what only a real host can - FX chain add/remove, parameter automation,
project save/reload, macro resync. It overwrites `Scripts/__startup.lua`
in REAPER's resource path, so remove that file before using REAPER
interactively. A host with no live audio device only processes during a
render, so the matrix forces a short render before reading any status
parameter.

```bash
./scripts/check-cross-platform-parity.sh
```

Both smoke hosts render a fixed score through the real MicroPython sidecar
and the raw float32 PCM is compared. The current result is an identical
SHA-256 - the platforms agree exactly, not within a tolerance.

`./reaper.sh` renders and plays the example pieces; see
[reaper/README.md](../reaper/README.md) and
[examples/soundtrack/README.md](../examples/soundtrack/README.md).

## Workspace isolation

The sibling `audiodsp` and `audiocomponents` repositories are consumed
read-only - no build or formatting command here writes into either. The
engine builder does not patch
the sibling MicroPython checkout either: it refuses one that does not already
carry the PyDevices overlay (`scripts/fetch-sibling-repos.sh` applies it once),
and its output lands in the port's own `build-vst3-engine` directory.

## Deferred

- Effect extras: a wet/dry mix parameter and sidechain input buses.
- Float64 host processing and a native floating-point audiodsp graph.
- macOS bundles, signing, notarisation, and universal binaries.
- Coverage-guided fuzzing. `tests/fuzz` exposes libFuzzer entry points;
  configure with `-DMPVST_ENABLE_LIBFUZZER=ON` on a clang toolchain and
  keep interesting inputs in `tests/fuzz/corpus`. The portable driver runs
  on every toolchain as an ordinary test regardless.
