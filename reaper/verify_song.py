"""Compare the REAPER bounce of Perihelion against the offline preview.

The preview (audiodsp CPython wheel) and the bounce (real plug-in, real
MicroPython sidecars, real automation) should agree on the shape of the
piece: same sections loud, same sections quiet, sane peaks, no dead air.
Exact PCM equality is not expected - pan law, envelope timing, and event
quantisation all differ slightly.

Usage: verify_song.py <bounce.wav> <preview.wav>
