# Scripts

Maintainer and bootstrap automation - things a fresh clone or a release
needs, not day-to-day dev workflow (see [`../tools/`](../tools/README.md)
for that). Every script here is idempotent: safe to rerun.

- **`bootstrap.sh`** - one-shot setup for a fresh clone: runs every
  script below in order, then configures, builds, and runs the test
  suite as a final verification. Start here.
- **`fetch-sibling-repos.sh`** - clones/updates the three sibling repos
  the builds depend on: `audiodsp` and the org's MicroPython
  [build-aggregator workspace](https://github.com/PyDevices/cmods) for
  the engine, and `audiocomponents` for the `audioinstruments` and
  `audioeffects` packages the plug-in build stages into the bundle
  (private until it is flipped public, so that clone fails for anyone
  outside the org until then).
- **`fetch-vst3-sdk.sh`** - downloads the pinned VST3 SDK into `.deps/vst3sdk`.
- **`build-micropython-engine.sh [--port windows|unix]`** - builds the
  MicroPython sidecar engine (defaults to the Windows engine, the
  shipping product; `--port unix` builds the same module set for Linux).
- **`install-plugin-windows.sh [--no-build]`** - builds the Windows VST3
  bundle and installs it into the per-user VST3 directory any DAW scans.
- **`package-linux.sh`** / **`package-windows.sh`** - assemble the
  release archive for each platform's VST3 bundle.
- **`check-cross-platform-parity.sh`** - renders a fixed score through
  both platforms' real sidecars and compares the PCM byte for byte.

REAPER itself is a separate, deletable concern - its installer
(`install-reaper-portable.sh`) now lives in
[`../reaper/`](../reaper/README.md) alongside everything else that needs
it, not here. `bootstrap.sh` still calls it as one step of a fresh-clone
setup.
