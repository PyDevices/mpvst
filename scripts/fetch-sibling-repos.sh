# Clone the sibling repos the builds need. For
# scripts/build-micropython-engine.sh: cmods (the MicroPython + usermod
# build system) and audiodsp (the synthio/audiocore DSP the engine links).
# For the plug-in build: audiocomponents (the audioinstruments and
# audioeffects packages src/plugin/CMakeLists.txt stages into the bundle).
# Idempotent - safe to rerun.
#
#   ./scripts/fetch-sibling-repos.sh
#
# All three are expected as siblings of this repo's own parent directory,
# matching build-micropython-engine.sh's and the plug-in CMake defaults;
# CMODS_DIR overrides where cmods goes (audiodsp has no override -
# build-micropython-engine.sh always looks for it at
# "$workspace_dir/audiodsp"; MPVST_COMPONENTS_LIB points the plug-in build
# at an audiocomponents lib/ elsewhere, but the clone here still lands
# beside the others).
#
# audiocomponents is private until it is flipped public (tracked in
# audiocomponents#2). Until then its clone fails for anyone without access
# to the org repo, and this script stops there - it is cloned last so cmods
# and audiodsp have already landed.
#
# Deliberately does NOT force-update an already-cloned sibling (no
# `git reset --hard`): all three are commonly hand-edited alongside this
# repo, and a clone that already exists may be sitting on local commits
# nobody has pushed yet. If it's already there, this just fetches and
# reports how far behind/ahead of origin/main it is, and leaves updating
# it to you.
